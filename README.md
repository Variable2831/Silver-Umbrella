This repository is focused on data analysis using C#. It includes sample code and projects using libraries such as Math.NET, NumSharp, and Accord.NET. The repository is open source for developers to learn about data analysis in C# and provide a starting point for their own data analysis projects.

Please note that this project is still a work in progress. I am actively working on it and plan to add more features soon. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.üëç
